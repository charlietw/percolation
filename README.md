# Percolation

Provides a computational model to determine whether, on a grid of n by n, water would percolate from the top to the bottom. For example:

[Graph to show does percolate](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/percolates-yes.png)

The solution I have written implements union quick find with path compression to ensure efficiency with large scale, and avoids all quadratic algorithms.
